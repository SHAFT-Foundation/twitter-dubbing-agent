# UI Design Prompt for Crypto Twitter Influencer Dubbing Platform

## Project Overview
Redesign a landing page for "Claude Code" - an AI-powered platform that automatically dubs Twitter/X videos and Spaces into 20+ languages for crypto influencers and Web3 creators. The current design is too corporate - we need something that screams crypto culture while maintaining professionalism.

## Target Audience
- **Primary**: Crypto Twitter influencers (KOLs, traders, educators)
- **Age**: 20-40 years old
- **Vibe**: Tech-savvy, early adopters, meme-aware, value engagement
- **Pain Point**: Missing global audience due to language barriers
- **Examples**: Crypto educators explaining DeFi, NFT artists, traders sharing alpha, Web3 builders

## Design Requirements

### Visual Style
- **Aesthetic**: Web3/Crypto native - think somewhere between Uniswap, Rainbow Wallet, and Magic Eden
- **Color Palette**: 
  - Dark mode primary (crypto loves dark mode)
  - Neon accents (electric blue, purple, green glows)
  - Gradient meshes and aurora effects
  - Consider holographic/iridescent elements
- **Typography**: Modern, bold, possibly mono-spaced for certain elements
- **Must Include**: 
  - Animated gradients
  - Glassmorphism effects
  - Subtle particle effects or floating elements
  - Web3 wallet-style UI components

### Key Sections to Design

1. **Hero Section**
   - Headline: "Turn every post into every language" (or suggest better)
   - Sub-headline about reaching global crypto community
   - Animated globe or network visualization showing language connections
   - "Get Early Access" CTA button (make it pop - think "Mint" or "Claim" button style)
   - Show supported languages as floating badges/chips
   - Maybe add live counter of "X dubs completed" or "X languages supported"

2. **Social Proof Bar**
   - "Trusted by 1000+ Crypto KOLs" 
   - Scrolling logos/avatars of crypto Twitter accounts
   - Or Twitter embed previews showing dubbed content

3. **How It Works** (make it visual and fun)
   - Step 1: "Connect your X" (wallet-connect style animation)
   - Step 2: "Pick languages" (flag emojis floating)
   - Step 3: "AI does the magic" (sparkles, processing animation)
   - Use isometric illustrations or 3D icons

4. **Features Grid** (but make it exciting)
   - "Reach Crypto Twitter Japan ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ" 
   - "Tap into Chinese DeFi community ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³"
   - "Spanish-speaking NFT collectors ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸"
   - Each feature could have mini animations on hover
   - Show potential reach multipliers (3x engagement, 10x reach)

5. **Pricing** (crypto-style)
   - Free tier: "3 dubs/month" (presented like an airdrop)
   - Pro tier: "$29.99" (maybe show in USD + crypto equivalent)
   - Make it look like NFT mint tiers or DeFi yield farming cards

6. **Email Capture**
   - Style like a Web3 allowlist/whitelist signup
   - "Join the allowlist" or "Get early access"
   - Progress bar showing spots remaining
   - Success state: "You're on the list! ðŸŽ‰"

### UI Elements Style Guide

**Buttons**:
- Primary CTA: Gradient with glow effect on hover
- Secondary: Glass morphism with border
- All buttons should have satisfying hover states

**Cards**:
- Glass morphism with subtle borders
- Soft shadows with color tints
- Micro-animations on hover

**Backgrounds**:
- Dark gradient mesh (dark purple to black)
- Floating gradient orbs in background
- Subtle grid pattern or dots
- Northern lights effect for hero

**Icons**:
- Neon line icons
- Or 3D rendered icons with glow
- Crypto-relevant: globes, language bubbles, network nodes

### Animation Ideas
- Floating language flags that orbit around a central element
- Morphing text showing translations in real-time
- Particle effects connecting different language nodes
- Smooth parallax scrolling
- Hover effects that feel premium

### Copy Suggestions (make it crypto-native)
- "Ship content to every timezone"
- "Your alpha, now in 20+ languages"
- "Go global. Stay degen."
- "From CT to the world"
- "Dubbing so good, they'll think you're native"
- "Stop leaving money in non-English markets"

### Mobile Responsive
- Must look equally cool on mobile
- Simplified animations for performance
- Thumb-friendly CTAs
- Maintain the Web3 aesthetic on small screens

### Inspiration References
- **Color/Gradients**: Uniswap V3, Linear app
- **Glass morphism**: iOS control center, Stripe
- **Web3 elements**: Rainbow wallet, WalletConnect
- **Dark mode**: Vercel, Railway
- **Fun elements**: Discord, Friends.tech
- **Typography**: Monospace for numbers/stats like Etherscan

## Technical Constraints
- Built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS
- Components should be implementable with Framer Motion
- Keep it performant (no heavy 3D unless using Three.js)
- Lighthouse score must stay above 90

## Deliverables Needed
1. Figma/Sketch file with all components
2. Color palette and gradients (CSS code)
3. Animation specifications
4. Mobile and desktop versions
5. Dark mode only (no light mode needed)
6. Hover/active states for all interactive elements

## Vibe Check
The design should make a crypto influencer think:
- "This looks legit Web3, not Web2 trying to be Web3"
- "This could 10x my engagement"
- "I want to flex that I use this"
- "This feels like the future"

## Avoid
- Corporate/sterile design
- Stock photos of people in suits
- Generic "SaaS" look
- Boring static layouts
- Light mode as primary
- Web2 social media aesthetics

Remember: Crypto Twitter loves tools that look as innovative as the space itself. Make it feel like a DeFi dashboard and a creative tool had a beautiful baby.

**Note**: The current implementation uses React/Next.js with Tailwind CSS. All designs should be translatable to Tailwind utility classes and custom CSS. Bonus points if you provide the actual Tailwind classes for gradients and effects!

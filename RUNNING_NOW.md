Your app is now running at: **http://localhost:3002**

### 👀 Open in Browser

## 🎨 Live Editing Mode Active

Any changes you make to files will instantly refresh in the browser!

### Try These Quick Edits:

1. **Change Hero Headline**
   - File: `apps/web/components/landing/HeroSection.tsx`
   - Line 23: Change "Turn every post into every language"
   - Save and watch it update instantly!

2. **Change Button Color**
   - File: `apps/web/components/landing/HeroSection.tsx`
   - Line 36: Change `from-blue-600 to-purple-600` to any colors

## 🛠 While It's Running

### Check Server Status
The terminal shows:
- ✅ Server running on port 3002
- ✅ Live reload active
- Any compilation errors will show here

### Test Email Form (Optional)
If you want emails to actually save:
1. Add your Supabase credentials to `apps/web/.env.local`
2. Restart the server (Ctrl+C, then `PORT=3002 yarn dev`)

But the UI works fine without Supabase!

## 🛑 To Stop the Server
Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal

# Open new terminal tab for these:
